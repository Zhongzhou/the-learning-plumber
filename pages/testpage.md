I found out that if you delete the front matter of the page, it won't appear in the navigation menu, so I can create many more pages without clogging the navigation menu too much so it looks odd. 

As long as there is a front matter, the page title will show up in the navigation menu, and sometimes it looks all clogged up.

The page still shows up correctly though.
