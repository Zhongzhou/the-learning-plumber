# Why "Learning Plumber"? 

You may have heard the title "*Learning Engineers*": people who are skillful enough to build cool tools for better learning. I started calling myself a "Learning Plumber" a while ago becasue:  
  1. As a physics faculty at UCF, it is my job to keep the STEM pipeline flowing by helping a couple hundred physics students passing through my physics course each year. 
  2. I'm not a software developer, but I love to grab new and cool tools from engineers, such as LLMs, to patch leaks and unclogg that STEM pipeline.
  3. I have a lovely wife and two lovely daughters....I'm destined to be THE PLUMBER in our house for the rest of my life!!!
