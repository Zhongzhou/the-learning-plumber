## How I got this blog started

I started building this site five months before my sabbatical actually starts, mainly because I am already starting to dig deeper into the world of LLMs as part of my own research, and I wish to document my entire learning experience for others as a reference.

But first, I'm going to share some resources on how to build a github pages site from scratch. It actually isn't that hard thanks to the large numbers of tutorials and resources online. Github pages is a great alternative if you, like me, couldn't stand Wordpress and is looking for a more simple way of publishing your writing and managing your resources.
