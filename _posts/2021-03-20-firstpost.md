## Bye Wordpress, Hello GitHub!

For some reason I couldn't stand WordPress, even though it is the most popular blog site in the world. I just could never figure out how to do anything in its user interface.

<img src="../assets/images/github-pages-examples.png" width="100" style = "float: left; margin-right: 2em"
alt = "Github Pages image from the github pages official site.">
So guess what, I asked GPT what else can I do? (Seriously, I think somewhere in the world someone is already starting to worship GPT as a god. I feel like a shaman everytime I do "prompt engineering") And long and behold, it suggested github pages.

If you share my dicontent towards WordPress, then I strongly suggest that you give GitHub Pages a try. I am anything but a git expert. In fact, for quite a while "git" was this scary thing that everytime I touched it I end up with a million error messages. But fortunately, this thing saves the day by making the basic operations relatively easy:

### Tutorials and resources for building a Github pages site

* [Github skills interactive course](https://github.com/skills/github-pages)\
You get a site setup in an hour just following this course, if you have just a little bit previous coding experience.
Note: look at the discussion forum/issues report of the course to figure out how to visit your created site. That gave me a little hiccup.
* [Markdown reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links)\
How to do basic formatting on the pages. 
* [Lots of useful things such as adding images](https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/)\
Basically just html hacks beyond what markdown has to offer.
* [Adding a comments section in your posts](https://utteranc.es/)\
This is a must for starting a blog post!!
* [Github pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

#### Let me know in the comments if you successfully setup a github pages site!
