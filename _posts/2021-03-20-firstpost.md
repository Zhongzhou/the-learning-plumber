## Bye Wordpress, Hello GitHub!

I started building this site five months before my sabbatical actually starts, mainly because I am already starting to dig deeper into the world of LLMs as part of my own research, and I wish to document my entire learning experience for others as a reference.

But first, I'm going to share some resources on how to build a github pages site from scratch. It actually isn't that hard thanks to the large numbers of tutorials and resources online. Github pages is a great alternative if you, like me, couldn't stand Wordpress and is looking for a more simple way of publishing your writing and managing your resources.

### Tutorials and resources for building a Github pages site

* [Github skills interactive course](https://github.com/skills/github-pages)\
Note: look at the discussion forum/issues report of the course to figure out how to visit your created site.
* [Github pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
* [Lots of useful things such as adding images](https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/)
* [Markdown reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links)
* [Adding a comments section in your posts](https://utteranc.es/)

(I searched for how to build a blog site on ChatGPT and Github site popped up as second best free option)\
(You can't completely trust GPT in writing code such as your site configuration file)
