## Getting things ready for my upcoming journey

The first thing that I want to do is to setup this site, so that's what I'm doing now, well before the project actually  starts.

At the same time, I have also started looking into things such as LangChain and setting up API connections with Azure OpenAI, so I think I better start early.

This post will obviously be updated in the future.
