## Getting things ready for my upcoming journey

The first thing that I want to do is to setup this site, so that's what I'm doing now, well before my actual sabbatical starts.

Yet I'm already starting to dive into the world of LLMs, so I'll keep upding this post so that my initial learning expreience are not lost.

This post will obviously be updated in the future.
