# The Junk Food Summary of a Healthy Paper
Some papers are like a giant bowl of Quinoa salad with no dressing: you know it is really good for you but you just need a lot of self-discipline to finish it.

Here is one such paper: Kaldaras, L., Akaeze, H. O., & Reckase, M. D. (2024). Developing valid assessments in the era of generative artificial intelligence. Frontiers in Education, 9, 1399377. [https://doi.org/10.3389/FEDUC.2024.1399377/BIBTEX]. It has an whole lot of great stuff, but, I have say that reading through it requires a couple cups of coffee to say the least.

So I decided to create a junk food version summary of this paper: it will be much easier and more enjoyable to eat, and it at least has a little bit of veggie in it. 

# The Key Message
Suppose we want to know if someone knows how to make a burger. Traditionally, the tests contain multiple choice questions such as "Which of the following ingredients are included in a burger?". Now, with GenAI, we can ask the person: How do you make a burger? and use GenAI to grade it. Nice. But how do we know if those new GenAI based tests really reflect someone's ability to make a juicy burger? That is the question of test validity.
