Working with LLMs is pretty much like doing a bit of alchemy, especially prompt engineering.  

## What I want to learn to do: 
 
1. Communicate with LLMs via API and for batch processing of tasks. 

3. Text Embedding + clustering using LLM.

4. Making a function call to an external agent/program using LLMs. For example, make it call python symbolic processor. 

5. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) ()


## Applications and interesting experiments

1. Have LLM judge the reliability of its own outcome and raise the most problematic ones.

2. Get LLMs to draw/modify diagrams in SVG/Tikz

## Tips and Tricks

1. Getting "dill" to work when an LLM object is present in python notebook.
