title: "A wishlist of LLM alchemy that I want to learn"

# A list of technical things that I want to learn: 
 
1. Communicate with LLMs via API. (and ways to control the output format/quality)
2. Setting up a small language model (SLM) from HuggingFace on a local or cloud cluster. 
3. Text Embedding using LLM or SLM (and clustering)
4. Function calling from within LLMs: 
5. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and maybe also knowledge graphs.
6. Are there ways to instruct an LLM to provide a confidence score for each generation?
7. Fine tuning an SLM if I have enough data/power

Moonshot: Training LLMs to generate svg diagrams?

# What I want to use LLM Alchemy to do with teaching:

1. LLM assisted assessment item generation
2. Zero shot open response grading/feedback. 
3. What else?
