2. **His Research**: Chen started to do [computational biophysics](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006349508702005) as a PhD student.

    * He now loves coding before a screen all day analyzing student behavior from data. Inconsistency runs in his family it seems.

3. **His Education**:
