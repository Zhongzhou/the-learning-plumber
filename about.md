# Ten fun facts about Zhongzhou Chen (Chen), the "learning plumber".

1. His father gave him the name "Zhongzhou" （重周） from a famous piece of ancient Chinese literature. His father also taught him English from a very young age hopeing that he will one day study in an English speaking country. 

        Clearly his dad wasn't very consistent on those two things .... So now he tells everyone to just call him "Chen" for simplicity. 

2. Chen first did computational biophysics  as a PhD student. He soon got tired of coding before a screen all day and switched to physics education because it has more connection with human. As a physics education researcher, Chen is highly focused on educational data mining, learning analytics, [online and blended learning](./pages/testpage.md), and recently prompt engineering and LLMs.

        He loves coding before a screen all day analyzing student behavior from data. Inconsistency runs in the family it seems.
