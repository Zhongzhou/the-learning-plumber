# Ten fun facts about Zhongzhou Chen (Chen), the "learning plumber".

1. **His name**: His father gave him the name "Zhongzhou" （重周） from a famous piece of ancient Chinese literature. His father also taught him English from a very young age hoping that he will one day study in an English speaking country. 
    * Clearly his dad wasn't very consistent on those two things .... So now he tells everyone to just call him "Chen" for simplicity. 

2. **His Research**: Chen started to do [computational biophysics](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006349508702005) as a PhD student. He soon got tired of coding before a screen all day and switched to physics education because it has more connection with human. As a physics education researcher, Chen is highly focused on [educational data mining](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED593227.pdf), learning analytics, [online and blended learning](./pages/testpage.md), and recently Generative AI and LLMs.
    * He now loves coding before a screen all day analyzing student behavior from data. Inconsistency runs in his family it seems.

3. **His Education**: Chen was trained as a Lighting and Illumination Engineer in Fudan University in Shanghai. His undergraduate thesis was on designing a self-feedback device to control the light output of an LED. At the same time, he published two papers working on theoretical calculations of vortex lattice structure in Bose-Einstein condensates (which he still don't understand till this day). He also started doing stand-up comedy (相声) as a student.
In 2005 Chen started his PhD at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, first working on computational biophysics, then on Physics Education and Multi-media learning. He also co-founded one of the most successful Chinese stand-up comedy groups (相声社) in North America at the time. 
In 2013, Chen started his postdoc at MIT, working under the mentorship of [Dave Pritchard](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/david-pritchard/), and worked on AB experiments in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). He quickly became a core member of the Chinese standup comedy club in Boston area (浮云社), and wrote several comedy scripts. 
    * In a parallel universe, Chen was one of the most successful stand-up comedian in China, and makes a lot more money than he does right now, oh well....
