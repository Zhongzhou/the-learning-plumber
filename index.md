title: Welcome to my journey into AI and LLMs
---

## About this blog

  This blog is part of my plan for my sabbatical year (2024- 2025). During which I will document my journey of me venturing into the world of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)I, and trying to figure out how (or whether) this transformative new technology could be used to fundamentally transform teaching and learning. (or maybe not?) The hope is that this blog and related resources can help lower both the technological and psychological barriers for other teachers/education researchers with similar background to adopt LLM and related technology.

  I'm also planning to dig deeper into a seemingly trivial education theory problem that has been bugging me a lot lately: 

  <center><em>How can we really know if someone knows something?</em></center>
  
  In future blogposts, I'll explain why I think this is such a hard question without a clear answer, and share my journey looking into different kinds of literature.


## About the name *"Learning Plumber"*

You may have heard about "Learning Engineers": people who are capable of developing and deploying (computer-based) tools for the improvement of learning. As a physics education researcher by training, I don't know enough to create tools myself, but I do love takeing greal tools from the engineers, and using them in my classroom to keep the STEM pipeline flowing smoothly and patch up the leaks as much as possible. That's why I call myself a "Learning Plumber".
