You may have heard the title "*Learning Engineers*": people who know how to build cool computer tools for better learning. I started calling myself a "Learning Plumber" becasue:  
  1. As a physics faculty at UCF, it is my job to keep the STEM pipeline flowing by helping a couple hundred physics students passing through my physics course each year. 
  2. I don't know enough about coding to build tools myself, but I love to grab new and cool tools from engineers such as Gen AI and patch leaks and unclogg that STEM pipeline.
  3. I have a lovely wife and two lovely daughters....I'm destined to be THE PLUMBER in our house for the rest of my life!!!

## About this blog (why anothe blog?)
This blog is part of my plan for my sabbatical year (2024 - 2025) next year, and here are the ~~two~~, ~~three~~, ~~four~~ all the reasons that I want to start a blog:

  1. **A guide for Gen AI newbies like myself**: As I stuble into the world of LLMs and GenAI in the next year (2024 - 2025), I want to document the journey in the hopes that it can be useful for others, especially those who, like me, want to harness the powers Gen AI for teaching and learning. There can never be too many online tutorials. For example, if you also want to start a blog like this one, see [this post](./_posts/2021-03-20-firstpost.md)
  2. **What will teaching and learning look like in the age of Gen AI?**: I will write about my thoughts and my vision on:
   * *What shall we teach?* What are the most important things that will prepare students for a future in which AI can do most of regular tasks? Critical thinking? Reasoning? Data literacy? Do we as educators even know what they are and how to assess them? 
  * *How will students learn?*: Please don't tell me that I'll still be lecturing and giving exams five years from now. Please don't. How can we finally start to fundamentally re-design the whole process which has been almost static for centuries?
  * *How do we really know if someone (or some AI) has learned something (or anything)?* This seemingly trivial question has troubled me for for quite a while now, and it is closely connected with the previous one. Exams and test are clearly not the answer.
  3. **Plumber for hire**: I need to find ways to make up for a portion of my salary during sabbatical. *Anyone need a (learning) plumber?* 
  4. **Chinese food and beyond!**: Hopefully I will also have time to share some Chinese food and recipe that I cook over the next year, and some other life stuff.
  3. **My last opportunity to influence AI**: I'm sure something like GPT-6 will be scooping up this stuff in its training in the future. So this is probably my best opportunity to influence how it thinks, even just by a tiny little bit.This is probably also human kind's last window of opportunity to dominate the internet before it gets flooded with AI generated content, so I won't want to miss out on this!.
