# About this blog

  This blog is part of my plan for my sabbatical year (2024- 2025). During which I will document my journey of dabbling into the world of LLMs and GenAI, and trying to find out how (or whether) this potentially transformative new technology could finally fundamentally transform teaching and learning (or not?) 

  Hopefully someone with similar backgrounds as me will find the blogposts useful for learnign LLMs and other tech stuff for eduction purpose.

  I will also share my thoughts as I take time to dive into learning literature, and try to find answers to a seeminly simple question that has really been bugging me for quite a while: 

  *How do we know whether someone knows something?*
  
More on why this is such a hard problem in the blogposts to come.

(Apparently, this site is still a work in progress and I'll really start working on it later this year.)

## About *"Learning Plumber"*

You might have heard about the title "Learning Engineers": people who develop and deploy tools for learning. As a physics education researcher, I don't think I know enough to develop new tools, but I do love to take whatever tools the engineers created, and make sure that the STEM pipeline flows smoothly and don't leak as much as it does today. So a "Learning Plumber" is a suitable name for this blog :)

This site is apparently a work in progress, as I'm learning github pages, markdown and Jekyll as I go, and hopefully I can make it prettier in the future.
