## About the name *"Learning Plumber"*

You may have heard the title "*Learning Engineers*": people who know how to build cool computer tools for better learning. I started calling myself a "Learning Plumber" becasue:  
  1. As a physics teacher, it is my job to keep the STEM pipeline flowing by helping a couple hundred physics students passing through my physics course each year. 
  2. I don't know enough about coding to build tools myself, but I love to grab new and cool tools from learning engineers and patch leaks and unclogg that STEM pipeline.
  3. I have a lovely wife and two lovely daughters....I'm destined to be THE PLUMBER in our house for the rest of my life!!!

## Why another blog?

  This blog is part of my plan for my sabbatical year (2024- 2025). During which I will document my journey of me venturing into the world of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)I, and trying to figure out how (or whether) this transformative new technology could be used to fundamentally transform teaching and learning. (or maybe not?) The hope is that this blog and related resources can help lower both the technological and psychological barriers for other teachers/education researchers with similar background to adopt LLM and related technology.

  I'm also planning to dig deeper into a seemingly trivial education theory problem that has been bugging me a lot lately: 

  <center><em>How can we really know if someone knows something?</em></center>
  
  In future blogposts, I'll explain why I think this is such a hard question without a clear answer, and share my journey looking into different kinds of literature.

This site is apparently still a work in progress, as I'm learning to build Github pages as we go. Let me know your thoughts by leaving your comments below!
